# Logging and Observability

webKinPred writes application logs as one JSON object per line. Docker still prefixes lines in `docker compose logs` (for example `celery-1 |`), but the application payload after that prefix is JSON and can be parsed by Loki, `jq`, or other log tooling.

## Log Shape

Common fields:

- `timestamp`: UTC ISO timestamp.
- `level`: Python log level.
- `service`: `backend`, `celery`, `celery-beat`, or `webkinpred` fallback.
- `logger`: Python logger name.
- `event`: stable event key, such as `subprocess.started`.
- `request_id`: propagated from `X-Request-ID` or generated per Django request.
- `job_public_id`: public job id, when known.
- `celery_task_id`: Celery task id, when known.
- `method_key`: prediction method, when known.
- `target`: prediction target, when known.

Useful Celery events:

- `celery.task.started`
- `celery.task.finished`
- `celery.task.failed`
- `prediction.method_started`
- `subprocess.started`
- `subprocess.progress`
- `subprocess.stderr_line`
- `subprocess.completed`
- `subprocess.failed`
- `http.request`
- `http.request_failed`

The prediction subprocess protocol is unchanged: method scripts may still write `Progress: x/y` to stdout. The backend parses those lines for database-backed frontend progress. Operational logs are separate and structured.
Gunicorn access logs are disabled in Docker because the Django request middleware emits structured request logs instead.

## Local Development

Run the normal development stack:

```bash
docker compose up backend celery celery-beat redis frontend
```

Inspect structured Celery logs:

```bash
docker compose logs celery --tail 100
```

Increase subprocess verbosity when debugging model output:

```bash
SUBPROCESS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG docker compose up celery
```

## Production Observability Stack

The production compose file includes Loki, Promtail, and Grafana.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d loki promtail grafana
```

Grafana is exposed on port `3001` by default. Set credentials with:

```bash
GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER=admin GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD='change-me' docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d grafana
```

Promtail reads Docker container logs, parses the JSON payload, and labels logs with `service`, `level`, `event`, `job_public_id`, `celery_task_id`, `method_key`, and `target`.

## Common LogQL Queries

All logs for a job:

```logql
{service="celery"} | json | job_public_id="mReUVED"
```

All logs for a Celery task:

```logql
{service="celery"} | json | celery_task_id="f4007945-92fe-41c0-9229-127304d14e9d"
```

Method failures:

```logql
{service="celery"} | json | level="ERROR" | method_key="EITLEM"
```

Subprocess output warnings/errors:

```logql
{service="celery", event="subprocess.stderr_line"} | json
```

Completed subprocess durations:

```logql
{service="celery", event="subprocess.completed"} | json | unwrap duration_ms
```

Backend request errors:

```logql
{service="backend"} | json | level="ERROR"
```

## Contributor Rules

- Do not add bare `print()` for operational logs in `api/` runtime code.
- Use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` and add stable `event` names in `extra`.
- Keep user-facing SSE/session messages on `push_line()`; those are product UX, not infrastructure logs.
- Keep method subprocess progress lines as `Progress: x/y` when adding new prediction scripts.
